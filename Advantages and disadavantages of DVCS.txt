
         DISMERITS OF CENTRAILIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM :

 ....The single point of failure embedded within the centralized server.

..... If the remote server goes down, then no one can work on the code or push changes. 

......The lack of offline access means that any disruption can significantly impact code development and  even result in code loss.


                 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF DISTURBUTED CONTROL SYSTEM


Advantages of Distributed Version Control System:

== Other than push and pull, all actions can be performed very quickly, since it is the hard drive, and not the remote server that is accessed       every time.
== Changesets can be committed to the local repository first and then a group of these changesets can be pushed to the central repository       in a single shot.
== Only the pushing and pulling activities need internet connectivity; everything else can be managed locally.
== Every developer has a complete copy of the entire repository and the impact any change can be checked locally before the code is pushed to the central repository.
== DVCS is built to handle changes efficiently, since every change has a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) that makes it easy to track.
== Tasks like branching and merging can be done with ease, since every developer has their own branch and every shared change is like       reverse integration 
== DVCS is very easy to manage compared to CVCS.


Disadvantages of Distributed Version Control System : 

== With many projects, large binary files that are difficult to compress, will occupy more space.
== Projects with a long history, i.e., a large number of changesets may take a lot of time and occupy more disk space.
== With DVCS, a backup is still needed, since the latest updated version may not be available to all the developers.
== Though DVCS doesnâ€™t prevent having a central server, not having a central server might cause confusions in identifying the right recent version.
== Though every repo has its own revision numbers, releases have to be tagged with appropriate names to avoid confusions.
