
IMAGE :

 == The "image" is the filesystem that is used to initialize, or create that instance.

SNAPSHOTS :

==  A snapshot is a base feature for creating backups of your EBS volumes. 
==A snapshot takes a copy of the EBS volume and places it in Amazon S3, where it is stored       redundantly in multiple Availability Zones. 
==The initial snapshot is a full copy of the volume; ongoing snapshots store incremental block-level      changes only.


DIFFERENCE B/W IMAGE AND SNAPSHOTS


Snapshots and images are two different types of data storage in Amazon AWS. A snapshot captures the state of a data store at a particular point in time, while an image stores a data store as a set of files.

Snapshots are helpful for taking a “snapshot” of a data store, so you can revert to a previous state if something goes wrong. For example, if you accidentally deleted a file from a data store, you can take a snapshot of the data store before you deleted the file, and then restore the snapshot to restore the file.


Images are used to store data permanently. When you create an image, you create a copy of the data store that you can access and use forever.

Images are useful for storing data that you don’t want to lose, or for storing data that you want to share with other people.
